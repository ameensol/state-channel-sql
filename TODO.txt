- Check that pg function signatures are sensible (ex, should immutable, strict, etc be added?)

- Replace the placeholder implementations of:
    - mcy_state_update_is_signature_valid
    - mcy_check_state_update

- Should there be a 'channel_id' composite datatype?

    create type mcy_channel_id as (
        chain_id integer,
        contract_id mcy_eth_address,
        channel_hash mcy_sha3_hash
    )

- Somehow translate between the values coming from Web3 with the values we're
  expecting.
    - Will values be in wei or eth? (I think wei, but need to be sure)
    - Convert Web3 events into ChannelEvent (esp getting the block hash,
      timestamp, etc)

- TODO: include the channel's remaining value in the `latest_state` message.

- Make sure that `mcy_insert_state_update` has locking or whatever to
  enforce serialization

- License, name, etc in package.json

- Ongoing maintanence and update workflow


Changes as of Jul 28 conversation:
- Make channels purely aggregate
- Add the "set blockchain state" function
- Introduce the the notion of "pending" events
